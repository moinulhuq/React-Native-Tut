/*
1. React Native is like React.
2. But React uses Web Components (<div>, <span>) where as React Native uses native components (<View>, <Text>).
3. To understand the basic of a React Native, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, state, and props.
4. JSX is an XML/HTML-like syntax used by React.
5. React components are like (<View>, <Text>) where as Web Components (<div>, <span>).
6. There are two types of data that control a React component
	a. state : is mutable. This means that state can be updated in the future where 'props' canâ€™t. we can initialize state in the constructor, and then call setState when we want to change it.

	example
	--------
*/	export default class HelloWorldApp extends Component {
	  constructor (props) {
	     super(props)
	     this.state = {
	       text: 'Hello World'
	     }
	  }

	  updateState = () => { 
	  	this.setState({ text: 'The state is updated' }) 
	  }

	  render() {
	    return (
	      <View>
	        <Text onPress = {this.updateState}>{this.state.text}</Text>
	      </View>
	    );
	  }
	}

/*	b. props are stand for Properties : are immutable and are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime of a component.

	example
	--------
*/	export default class HelloWorldApp extends Component {
	  render() {
	    
	    let pic = {
	      uri: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Bananavarieties.jpg'
	    };
	    
	    return (
			<Image source={pic} style={{width: 193, height: 110}}/>
	    );

	  }
	}

7. The above code might not look like JavaScript, this is the improvements of JavaScript done by ES2015 or ES6, for that you can use 'import', 'from', 'class', and 'extends'.*/
